    " The purple square is the square that the program is currently looking at to see if it can place any flags or open any boxes around that square, and" +
    " the turquoise squares are those that have been recently opened.",
    " The program loops through the minesweeper grid line by line until it finds a number. " +
    " It then looks at the surrounding squares to decide whether any flags should be placed or if any squares around can be opened. If the number of" +
    " the square we're currently looking at is 1 and there is already 1 flag around it, then all other surrounding squares can be opened. Or if there" +
    " are only 2 squares unopened and the square requires 2 more flags, these squares are both flagged." +
    " However, some minesweeper puzzles cannot be solved just using this method. Often there are times where it is" +
    " not clear just from looking at individual squares where a flag should be placed - this is shown in game 1 where the squares in the bottom right" +
    " are unsolvable just by looking at the individual squares. For these situations," +
    " the program creates permutations of flags and spaces for the squares around the numbered squares. " +
    " Perhaps there are 2 or 3 possible arrangements of flags and spaces around these numbered squares. Any squares that are marked as spaces" +

    " a square, when it creates combinations and adds the consistent squares until the grid" +
    " is completed.",
